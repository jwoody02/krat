# krat
simple remote access trojan (RAT) I made that doesn't get detected by any anti-virus. exports payloads in python and as of now must be on local network or use port forwarding on your wifi. Can do basic tasks like screenshots and can attempt to get administrator password. This rat was made for the purpose of mainly working on MacOS so I can't confirm which features work on windows yet. If target computer has MacOS monterey screenshot and other functions using applescript will not be discrete and I don't recommend trying. This is for educational purposes only never run on a computer you don't own as its illegal thank you.
